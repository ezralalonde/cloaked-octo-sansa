# Define a procedure, print_numbers, that takes
# as input a positive whole number, and prints 
# out all the whole numbers from 1 to the input
# number.

# Make sure your procedure prints "upwards", so
# from 1 up to the input number.

    ii = 0
    while ii < nn:
        ii = ii + 1
        print ii

#print_numbers(3)
#>>> 1
#>>> 2
#>>> 3
